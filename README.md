## Hi, I'm Sakhiur 👋

I’m a final-year Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) student currently in my 8th semester, studying **Software Engineering** alongside **Computer Architecture**.

I learn best by building complete systems end-to-end — experimenting fast, breaking things, and refining my understanding through hands-on work. My focus is on understanding *how systems behave in practice*, not just making features work.

### 🔧 What I actively work with
- **Applied AI & LLMs:** LangChain (Python), project-based experimentation
- **Web & Backend:** Next.js, Supabase
- **Systems & Fundamentals:** Assembly language, Computer Architecture concepts (academic + practice-oriented)
- **Databases:** Relational database design with practical usage


### 🧪 End-to-end projects
I have built and maintained multiple complete projects, including:

- **Ummah Connect**  
  *Emotion-based Islamic social media platform focused on women’s cyber safety.*  
  A research-oriented project exploring emotion-aware interactions and safer online environments.

- **Friendora**  
  *Anime-inspired social media platform designed for Gen Z users.*  
  Focused on product experience, branding, and real social-media-style workflows.

- **Resources-21**  
  *Official website for a medical equipment supplier company.*  
  Built as a real-world company project with practical business requirements and constraints.

### 🌱 Current focus
- Improving software engineering practices through real projects
- Strengthening system-level fundamentals alongside modern tools

### 🎯 Direction
My long-term goal is to pursue a **Master’s degree** while gaining experience through **part-time or applied software development work**.  
I’m interested in opportunities that value both **practical engineering skills** and **strong foundational knowledge**.

### 📌 Note
This profile reflects real project work and ongoing learning — not tutorial-only experimentation.
